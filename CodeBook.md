## Summary

This dataset summarizes various time- and frequency-domain variables computed from raw measurements, by computing averages by subject and activity performed. 

## Variables

* TestSubject : Reference identifier for subject who performed the test
* Activity : Activity performed 
 * WALKING 
 * WALKING_UPSTAIRS
 * WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS
 * SITTING
 * STANDING
 * LAYING
* ALL FOLLOWING VARIABLES: These are either time- or frequency- domain variables computed from raw measurement data.
 * The prefixes 't' and 'f' denote time and frequency domain respectively.
 * The '-X,-Y,-Z' denote measurement direction
 * The 'mean()' and 'std()' denote mean and standard deviations, respectively
 * All values represent averages, which have been computed by each subject as they performed each activity
 * Further details on the measurements and their computation are contained with the README.md file included with the zipped raw data (located at: https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip)
